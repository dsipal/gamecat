                    Welcome to GameCat- we're a small team of longtime gamers who fondly remember the days before microtransactions were the norm.
                    We realized that in today's world if you want to be at the top of your game you need to be able to spend your hard earned bucks.

                <p>
                    Whether it's unlocking in-game items that help you play, or the sick cosmetics that rule Fortnite, we want to make it easier for you - the average gamer - to have access to all the newest content.
                    Providing easy to earn gift cards, microtransactions will be far from the limit of what you can get through GameCat, anything from the newest games to gear on Amazon.

                <p>
                    We launched early 2019, and with our team's experience on other survey websites, our biggest emphasis in both customer support and development has been avoiding the drama that other survey websites are made of.
                    We don't believe in mysteriously deleting a user's profile right before they cash out and we especially hate it when you have to complete 50 offers for just 5 dollars.
